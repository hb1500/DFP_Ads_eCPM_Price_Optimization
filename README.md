# DFP_Ads_eCPM_Price_Optimization

The goal of the project is to optimize the BuzzFeed’s revenue from running programmatic ads by conducting in depth analysis on programmatic data and build models to predict the eCPM (effective cost per mille) prices by using machine learning models. Through this internship, I obtained domain knowledge in programmatic ads on publisher’s side, and understood how to solve business problems by applying data science skills.
